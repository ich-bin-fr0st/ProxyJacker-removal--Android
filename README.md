## What is Proxyjacking?

Proxyjacking is a cybersecurity threat where attackers hijack a user's internet bandwidth to make money. In this scheme:

- Hackers compromise devices and turn them into involuntary proxies.
- These proxies are then sold to companies, often disguised as legitimate sources.
- The companies use the bandwidth for various purposes, generating profit for the attacker.
